## Important Notes on Functionality

Please keep the following in mind when exploring Aura Events:

- **Public Event Access:** Anyone can see all listed events.
- **Simulated Interactions:**

  - **Ticket Booking:** Booking a ticket is just a test feature. Visitors can try it out, but no real bookings are made or saved.

  - **User Login:** Logging in is also a test feature. To use features like the dashboard or manage events, go to the `/dashboard` page and pick one of the three sample user profiles. This acts like a login.

- **User Roles & Permissions (Simulated):**
  - There are three sample user profiles you can choose from. They all have the same abilities.
  - After picking a user profile (like logging in), you can see that user's personal dashboard.
  - Only the "logged-in" user can add, edit, or drop events they "own". They can't change events made by other sample users.
- **Data Source:**
  - All event details, categories, locations, and user info come from a cloud database (Vercel Postgres via Neon).

This setup lets you test how the main app works and how user-specific parts behave, all within this example project.

- **Placeholder Pages/Features:** Please note that some pages or features mentioned or implied (e.g., dedicated "Favorites" page, language selection options) may not be fully implemented in this concept version and serve as placeholders for future development.

This means you can try out the main features and see how things work for different users in this sample app.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** JavaScript (JSX)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules
- **Database:** Vercel Postgres (Neon)
  - **Structure:** Employs a logical database schema with relational data modeling, including one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships between entities like events, users, categories, and locations.
- **Icons:** Lucide React (for vector icons)
- **State Management:** React Context
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router
- **Data Fetching:** Native Fetch API
- **Validation:** Client-side
- **Performance & Design:** Built with a mobile-first approach, focusing on fast loading times and a responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes (extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large).

## Design Philosophy & Creator's Vision

The look and feel of Aura Events came from looking at many different event websites and modern designs. The goal was to mix these ideas to create something new, easy to use, and nice to look at.

**Motivation & Complexity:**
This project was a big step in learning and using new web technologies, especially with Next.js. It's one of the more complex apps I've built, helping me improve my skills in building complete websites, making them work on all screen sizes, and managing how data changes in the app.

**Future Aspirations:**
The plan for Aura Events is to grow it from just an idea into a more complete and professional tool for managing events. The work put into it is aimed at making it a great example for my portfolio, showing I can build complex, useful apps.

The main idea was to make a clean, easy-to-use design that helps people find events easily, and to build it in a way that new features can be added later on.

## Notes for developer

For privacy and security, I don't share access to the main cloud database or where images are stored. If you want to set up the app with sample data using your own database, hereâ€™s how:

1.  **Database Connection (`.env.local`):**
    - Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database ready (you can run one on your computer or use a free one online).
    - In the main project folder, create a file named `.env.local`.
    - Add your database connection details to this file like this:
      ```env
      POSTGRES_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string_here"
      ```
2.  **Sample Data (`data/events.json`):**
    - The project includes a sample dataset located at `data/events.json`. This file contains event, category, location, and user data.
    - Image URLs within \`events.json\` typically reference images available within the project repository (e.g., in the \`public/images/\` directory). Ensure these local image paths are correctly set up in your environment if you are serving static assets.
3.  **Data Migration (`app/events/scripts/migrate-data.mjs`):**
    - A migration script is provided at `app/events/scripts/migrate-data.mjs`. This script will create the necessary database tables (if they don't exist), clear any existing data, and then populate the tables using the data from `data/events.json`.
    - To run the script, navigate to the project root in your terminal and execute:
      ```bash
      node app/events/scripts/migrate-data.mjs
      ```
    - Make sure your database is running and the `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env.local` is correctly configured before running the script.

### Testing the "Add Event" Form

- **Test Content:** Sample text and image references for testing the "Add Event" form can be found in the `/test` directory at the root of this project.

- **Accessing the Form:**
  1.  First, simulate a user login by navigating to the `/dashboard` page and selecting one of the user profiles.
  2.  Once on the user's dashboard, the "Add Event" button is located within the "My Events" table section. Clicking this button will open the "Add Event" form.

### Testing Event Management (Edit & Drop)

Once a user is "logged in" (simulated via the `/dashboard` page), they can manage events they own. There are two primary ways to access the management tools:

1.  **From the Event Detail Page:**
    - Navigate to the detail page of an event owned by the currently "logged-in" user (e.g., `/events/your-event-name`).
    - Scroll down the page to find the "Organizer Tools" section.
    - This section contains the "Edit Event" button (navigates to the edit form) and the "Drop Event" button (triggers a confirmation modal).
2.  **From the User Dashboard (`/dashboard`):**
    - Navigate to the dashboard of the "logged-in" user (`/dashboard`).
    - Locate the "My Events" table section.
    - Each row in this table for an event owned by the user includes:
      - A "Manage" button: Clicking this navigates directly to the Edit Event form for that specific event.
      - A "Drop" button: Clicking this triggers a confirmation modal. Confirming in the modal will simulate the deletion of the event from the database.

Remember that event management actions (Edit, Drop) are restricted to events owned by the currently selected user profile.

## Future Development Roadmap

Aura Events is an evolving platform with plans for significant enhancements and new features.
